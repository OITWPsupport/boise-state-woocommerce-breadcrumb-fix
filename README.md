# boise-state-woocommerce-breadcrumb-fix
Adds a Breadcrumb Settings item on the admin screen's left nav. On the Breadcrumb Settings form, you can change the text of the root breadcrumb item. This prevents the duplicate "Home" link that appears by default in the Storefront header and the Woocommerce breadcrumb.
